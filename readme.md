Koldy PHP Framework is zero-dependency near-core PHP framework for rapid web development. It's small and simple because
it gives you all the basic functionality you need to build your web apps. It's best used on medium and large scale enterprise
projects where you want to have full control over your code, but still be near-core PHP without any bloat. Small framework also
means smaller context usage for your AI tools.

To install the framework in your project, run:

```shell
composer require koldy/framework
```

To see the required structure of your project, please check the [docs](https://koldy.net) for detailed explanation or
simply use the [boilerplate](https://github.com/koldy/boilerplate).

This framework is built for every PHP developer who wants to simplify and speed up its web development using standards.

The main goal of this framework is to have MVC PHP framework which is simple, easy, fast, well documented inside your
IDE and stable over time. Framework itself has no dependencies other than standard PHP libs, so all the changes we do
are related to the PHP itself.
